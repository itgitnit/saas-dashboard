# SaaS Dashboard

This project is a SaaS Admin Dashboard built using **React**, **Material UI**, and **React Router**. It features a dashboard with widgets, data visualizations, and a customizable light/dark theme using a `ThemeContext`. Additionally, there is an **Order List** page with a paginated table, and more pages can be added seamlessly.

## Features

- **Light/Dark Theme** toggle using `Context API`
- **Responsive Layout** built with Material UIâ€™s Grid system
- **Dynamic Sidebar** with navigation links using `react-router-dom`
- **Dashboard Widgets** that display key metrics (customers, orders, revenue, etc.)
- **Charts and Data Visualization** for projections, revenue, and top-selling products
- **Order List** page with paginated table for viewing orders
- **Notifications & Activities** panel on the dashboard
